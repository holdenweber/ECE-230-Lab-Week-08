## Lab Summary
In this lab we learned how to use a ternary operator in 
Vivado. We also learned how to implement a 4-1 multiplexer
and feed that output into a 1-4 demultiplexer. 

## Lab Questions

### In plain English describe the function and use of a multiplexer.
A multiplexer is similar to a switch; it can have multiple input 
streams, but only take one input at a time. Depending on the logic read
from the input, it will take the single input and output it. 

### In plain English describe the function and use of a demultiplexer.
A demultiplexer is the exact opposite of a multiplexer. It takes in
just one input stream and can output multiple different outputs,
one at a time. 

### What other uses might these circuits have? (Think Shannonâ€™s)
A demultiplexer and multiplexer circuit can often be found in
broadcasting channels and the radio for different frequencies.
